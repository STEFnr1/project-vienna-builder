# project-vienna-builder
Batch file which downloads all necessary files and install Project Vienna into the current directory.

# Instructions
1. Make a new folder, with no unusual characters, such as Ă, Î etc.
2. Place the downloaded batch file in that folder, then run it. If you don't have Docker installed, run it as administrator.
3. Confirm the prompts, then let it download all the files and programs required.
4. After the files are moved, a prompt should automatically show up on your screen. If everything went well, you should receive a notification confirming everything was done correctly.

You can also check if the container is alive in Docker, as this script will automatically register it.
